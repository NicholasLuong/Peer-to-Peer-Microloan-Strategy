# Peer-to-Peer-Microloan-Strategy

End-to-End Business Analytics Final Project
In the following project, I explore a Microloan Dataset given by LendingCase. Microloans are non-traditional loans, typically smaller in amount, and are used to help individuals borrow money. These are usually peer-to-peer and carry significant amount of risks. In this project, we are looking to see how data analytics and machine learning principles can be used to help develop an investment strategy for investors.

## Peer-to-Peer/Microloans Dataset
LendingClub is one of the largest Peer-to-Peer lender in the United States and acts as the middle of between borrowers and investors. In the dataset, we can see several features that might have an impact on the investment strategy below:

1. Interest rate,
2. Loan amount,
3. Monthly installment amount,
4. Loan status (e.g., fully-paid, default, charged-off),
5. Several additional attributes related to the borrower such as type of house ownership,annual income, monthly FICO score, debt-to-income ratio, and number of open credit lines.

Typically, LendingClub issues loans between $1,000 to $40,000 for a duration of either 36 months or 60 months and their interest rates range from 6.7%-22.8%. With that said, it is important to discover which of these features will have the strongest impact on our portfolio.

## Files

In files, they are organized into several parts as seen below:

1. Business and Data Understanding
2. Diagnostic and Descriptive Analysis
3. Predictive Modeling: Probability of Default
4. Prescriptive Modeling: Ranking Using Predictors
5. Advanced Prescriptive Modeling: Optimization

They each represent different parts of the Data Analysis cycle. The files are written in R with the exception of Part 5 where I used Excel to perform a sensitivity analysis on different portfolios (Optimistic vs. Pessimistic) to determine which portfolio is most optimal. We used a Markowitz model to examine the relative performance of each portfolio.
